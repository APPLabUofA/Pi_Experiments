#####As of Dec 2018, here is a guide to get MuseLSL and the Muse working with the Pi 3

#####Make sure you have enough memory on the SD card, or else the Pi will not boot once restarted
#####Having said that, be sure to restart once updates and packages are installed


A)

#####If you want to run the newest version of MuseLSL (as of April 25, 2019), follow the steps below
#####Note that the newest version requires Python 3

#####Open a new terminal window and enter the following command:

sudo pip3 install muselsl

#####and this should install almost everything you need (it will take quite a long time)
#####Once everything is installed you'll need to downgrade the version the pygatt that's installed
#####enter the following commands:

sudo pip3 uninstall pygatt
sudo pip3 install pygatt==3.1.1

B)

#####If you want to install packages directly without using a virtual environment, open a terminal window and follow the steps below:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo pip install pygatt==3.1.1
sudo pip install pylsl==1.10.5
sudo pip install mne==0.17.0
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo pip install setuptools==33.1.1
sudo pip install scipy==0.18.1
sudo pip install matplotlib==2.0.0
sudo pip install bitstring==3.1.5
sudo pip install seaborn==0.7.1
sudo pip install pexpect==4.2.1
sudo pip install vispy==0.4.0
sudo pip install psychopy==1.83.4
sudo pip install sklearn==0.0
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get autoremove

#####once you have all the necessary packages installed (with or without a virtual environment)
#####Also run the below command in a terminal window to make the bluetooth app run with admin permissions

sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' `which hcitool`

#####Within the "Experiments" folder is another folder called "Packages"
#####"Packages" contains an older version of MuseLSL that will work with the Raspberry Pi
#####Newer versions of MuseLSL currently do not work properly with the Raspberry Pi and some of the Pi-specific packages

#####You will also need to download and add a file needed for pylsl

wget ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/LSL/SDK/liblsl-C-C++-1.11.zip
unzip liblsl-C-C++-1.11.zip
sudo cp liblsl-bcm2708.so /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pylsl/liblsl32.so

#####After following the above instructions, lsl and the Muse should now work with the built-in bluetooth of the Pi 3


C)

#####if you want to install miniconda (with Python 2) to use virtual environments, follow these steps:

wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
md5sum Miniconda-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
bash Miniconda-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
sudo reboot

#####open a terminal and enter the following:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

#####uncomment the third line and then save the file ('Ctrl X' > 'y' > 'Enter')
#####now run the following in the same terminal:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame

#####instructions on using anaconda/miniconda environments can be found here:

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

#####the exmaple below will create a virtual environment called 'eeg_experiments'
#####for the Raspberry Pi, we need to specify which version of python we want to use and 3.4.3 is the current version for miniconda on the Pi

conda create --name eeg_experiments python==2.7.13

#####now open a terminal (without activating your environment) and enter the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install gfortran
conda config --add channels rpi
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get autoremove

#####if you are using a virtual environment open a terminal window and follow the steps below (these assume you are using miniconda for creating virtual environments).
#####be sure to create and activate your environment (source activate eeg_experiments) before running these commands:


pip install pygatt==3.1.1
pip install pylsl==1.10.5
pip install mne==0.17.0
conda install scipy==0.18.1
conda install pkg-config
conda install freetype==2.7
pip install matplotlib==2.0.0 (might take some time)
pip install bitstring==3.1.5
pip install seaborn==0.7.1 (might take some time)
conda install pexpect==4.2.1
pip install vispy==0.4.0
pip install sklearn==0.0 (might take some time)
pip install pygame==1.9.3 (might take some time)
pip install rpi.gpio
#####


D)
#####once you have all the necessary packages installed (with or without a virtual environment)
#####Also run the below command in a terminal window to make the bluetooth app run with admin permissions

sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' `which hcitool`

#####Within the "Experiments" folder is another folder called "Packages"
#####"Packages" contains an older version of MuseLSL that will work with the Raspberry Pi
#####Newer versions of MuseLSL currently do not work properly with the Raspberry Pi and some of the Pi-specific packages

#####You will also need to download and add a file needed for pylsl

wget ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/LSL/SDK/liblsl-C-C++-1.11.zip
unzip liblsl-C-C++-1.11.zip

######if using the old version of Muselsl, which uses python 2

sudo cp liblsl-bcm2708.so /home/pi/miniconda/envs/eeg_experiments/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pylsl/liblsl32.so

######if using the newest version of MuseLSL which uses python 3. Note that the version number of python may need to be changed to whatever your current version is

sudo cp liblsl-bcm2708.so /home/pi/miniconda/envs/eeg_experiments/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pylsl/liblsl32.so

sudo cp liblsl-bcm2708.so /home/pi/.virtualenvs/muse_experiments_p373/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pylsl/liblsl32.so

#####After following the above instructions, lsl and the Muse should now work with the built-in bluetooth of the Pi 3
