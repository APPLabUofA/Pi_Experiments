When you edit or create autostart file in your user space like

~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
then, this file will override global lxsession autostart file in

/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
so you should copy everything from global file to your newly created file. By this way , after reboot you won't get a blank screen running openbox.

So, your file should contain

@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
@xscreensaver -no-splash
point-rpi
And then add your necessary startup items at the bottom like

@lxterminal

As an example, to open a python terminal window add the following line

@lxterminal -e python3

might be an idea to combine both experiments into one script, and then check for a button press

one press will start the baseline first, the other will start the oddball first

OR, the baseline task creates a file once finished and the oddball tasks deletes this file

the script could check for this file and skip the baseline task if needed

to run python files from within python, enter the following

import os
os.system('python /home/pi/research_experiments/Experiments/Packages/muse-lsl-master/muse-lsl-connect.py --name Muse-1E65')


this will run the script to connect the muse ot the pi
