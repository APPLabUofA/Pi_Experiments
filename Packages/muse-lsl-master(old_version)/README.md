# Muse LSL

This is a collection of Python scripts to use the Muse 2016 BLE headset with LSL.

![Blinks](blinks.png)

## Requirements

The code relies on [pygatt](https://github.com/peplin/pygatt) for the BLE communication.
pygatt works on Linux and should work on Windows and macOS provided that you have a BLED112 dongle.
You have to use the development version of pygatt, that can be installed with pip using:

`pip install git+https://github.com/peplin/pygatt`

You will also need to find the MAC address of your Muse headset. **This code is
only compatible with the 2016 version of the Muse headset.**

Finally, the code for streaming and recording data is compatible with Python
2.7 and Python 3.x. However, the code for stimulus presentation relies on
psychopy and therefore only runs with Python 2.7.

## Usage

To stream data with LSL:

`python muse-lsl.py`

The script will auto detect and connect to the first Muse device. In case you want
a specific device or if the detection fails, find the name of the device and pass it to the script :

`python muse-lsl.py --name YOUR_DEVICE_NAME`

You can also directly pass the MAC address (this option is also faster at startup):

`python muse-lsl.py --address YOUR_DEVICE_ADDRESS`

Once the stream is up and running, you can visualize it with

`python lsl-viewer.py`

## Available experimental paradigms

The following paradigms are available:

Paradigm | Stimulus presentation | Data | Analysis
---------|-----------------------|------|---------
Visual P300 | `stimulus_presentation/generate_Visual_P300.py` `stimulus_presentation/generate_Visual_P300_stripes.py`| `data/visual/P300/` | [click here](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/P300%20with%20Muse.ipynb)
Auditory P300 | `stimulus_presentation/generate_Auditory_P300.py` | `data/auditory/P300` | [click here](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/Auditory%20P300%20with%20Muse.ipynb)
N170 | `stimulus_presentation/generate_N170.py` | `data/visual/N170` | [click here](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/N170%20with%20Muse.ipynb)
SSVEP | `stimulus_presentation/generate_SSVEP.py` | `data/visual/SSVEP` | [click here](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/SSVEP%20with%20Muse.ipynb)
SSAEP | `stimulus_presentation/generate_SSAEP.py` | `data/auditory/SSAEP` | [click here](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/SSAEP%20with%20Muse.ipynb)
Spatial frequency | `stimulus_presentation/generate_spatial_gratings.py` | `data/visual/spatial_freq` | [click here](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/Spatial%20Frequency%20Task%20with%20Muse.ipynb)

The stimulus presentation scripts can be found under `stimulus_presentation/`.
Some pre-recorded data is provided under `data/`, alongside analysis notebooks under `notebooks`.

### Visual P300

The task is to count the number of cat images that you see. You can add new jpg images inside the [stimulus_presentation](stimulus_presentation/) directory: use the `target-` prefix for cat images, and `nontarget-` for dog images.

### Auditory P300

The task is to count the number of high tones that you hear.

### N170

The task is to mentally note whether a "face" or a "house" was just presented.

### SSVEP

The task is to passively fixate the center of the screen.

### SSAEP

The task is to passively fixate the center of the screen while listening to the sounds you hear.

### Spatial frequency gratings

The task is to passively fixate the center of the screen.

## Running an experiment

First, you have to run the muse-lsl script as described above.

In another terminal, run

`python stimulus_presentation/PARADIGM.py -d 120 & python lsl-record.py -d 120`

where `PARADIGM.py` is one of the stimulus presentation scripts described above (e.g., `generate_Visual_P300.py`).

This will launch the selected paradigm and record data for 2 minutes.

For data analysis, check out [these notebooks](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/notebooks/).

## Common issues

1. `pygatt.exceptions.BLEError: Unexpected error when scanning: Set scan parameters failed: Operation not permitted` (Linux)
 - This is an issue with pygatt requiring root privileges to run a scan. Make sure you have `libcap` installed and run ```sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' `which hcitool` ```


2. `pygatt.exceptions.BLEError: No characteristic found matching 273e0003-4c4d-454d-96be-f03bac821358` (Linux)
 - There is a problem with the most recent version of pygatt. Work around this by downgrading to 3.1.1: `pip install pygatt==3.1.1`
