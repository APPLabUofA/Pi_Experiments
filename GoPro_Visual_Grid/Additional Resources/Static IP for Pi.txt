Static IP for the Pi

sudo nano etc/dhcpcd.conf
# uncomment the following lines
# interface wlan0 # might be different interface - change it if needed
#static ip_address= 192.168.43.213/24
# static routers=192.168.43.1 # make sure the first 3 numbers are the same as wlan0 Inet #followed by .1
#static domain_name_servers=192.168.43.1 8.8.8.8 fd51:42f8:caae:d29e::1 # not needed
# IPv6 IP address

If config

	wlan0:	
		Inet 192.168.43.213 netmask 255.255.255.0

sudo apt install arp-scan # scan the network
If not  then - sudo apt update 

Test with
Ping ‘static routers’ # no quotes - in this example it would be 192.168.43.1

Might mess up on another network - in that case - just comment out the 3 lines you messed with

Ping -c 1 IP address
